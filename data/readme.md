This folder contains the raw and processed data. The raw data comes from Dr. Brian McKay's paper, 
"Virulence-mediated infectiousness and activity trade-offs and their impact on transmission potential of patients infected with influenza."

Here is the list of variables in the processed dataset. Our main outcomes and main predictor are labled as such. With the exception of BodyTemp, all variables are categorical, each indicating the prescence of a certain symptom. In some variables, there are multiple levels of severity for these categorical variables. The Body Temp variable is continuous.
